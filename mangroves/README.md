Brief summary of the study design:

> Propagules of Kandelia obovata and Kandelia candel were collected from a single northern and southern natural population, each,
> to compare both inter- and intra-specific differences in chilling tolerance.
> Propagules of K. obovata were collected from a northern population in Yunxiao County, Fujian, China
> and a southern population in Futian, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.
> Propagules of K. candel were collected from a northern population in Kuantan, Pahang, Malaysia
> and a southern population in Benut, Johor, Malaysia.
> To determine whether the chilling tolerance varies predictably with their geographic distribution,
> the performance of ten individuals from two populations in each species (n=20 per species and n=10 per population)
> was compared under optimal, chilling and post-chilling recovery conditions,
> using a Conviron climate chamber to manipulate temperature while holding all other environmental conditions constant.
> Within the climate chamber, the plants were acclimated to a temperature of 25°C/ 20°C (day/night).
> Upon acclimation, the temperature was gradually decreased by 2.5°C per day until 15°C/10°C (day/night) where it stayed for 72 h.
> This was followed by a further decrease by 2.5°C per day until 10°C/5°C (day/night), at which it lasted for 72 h.
> The temperature was then gradually increased to 25/20°C (day/night) over the span of five days
> and then kept at 25/20°C (day/night) for eight days to assess the recovery of the plants post stress.
> To characterize the photosynthetic efficiency of the four populations (two species),
> the effective quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) of at least three individuals per population per species
> was measured at each treatment condition. Chilling tolerance was defined as
> the ability of individuals to maintain an optimal Fv/Fm (>0.75) after chilling stress exposure.
> The Fv/Fm was measured under an optimal condition of 25°C after two weeks of acclimation, and 24 h after exposure to 15°C and 10°C.
> To assess the recovery of these species, Fv/Fm was measured on the second, sixth and eighth days of the recovery treatment at 25°C.
